        <h2>Fall off the bone instant pot ribs</h2>
        <p>
          This recipe has been a go to for my family for years during the winter
          months when its too cold to use the smoke. The ribs fall off the bone
          and the liquid smoke give a great flavor. I hope your family enjoys
          them as much as mine.

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Remove membranes from the back of ribs, if needed.</li>
          <li>Rubs seasonings over both sides of ribs.</li>
          <li>Place wire trivet rack in the bottom of the instant pot.</li>
          <li>
            Add water, apple juice (or apple cider vinegar) and liquid smoke
            (optional, but recommended for that great smokey flavor).
          </li>
          <li>
            Place the ribs upright, with the meat side facing out. If you’re
            using one large rack of ribs, then circle them around the pot.
          </li>
          <li>Secure lid and close vent.</li>
          <li>
            Press “manual” or “pressure cook” and cook on high pressure for 25
            minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            When the timer beeps, allow the pressure to naturally release for 15
            min, then turn the valve to quick release.
          </li>
          <li>
            Carefully remove ribs to a large, foil-lined baking sheet and
            slather them in BBQ sauce.
          </li>
          <li>
            Optional: broil them in the oven for 2-3 minutes to caramelize the
            bbq sauce.
          </li>
        </ol>
