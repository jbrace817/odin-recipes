      <h2>Fall off the bone instant pot ribs</h2>
      <p style="width: 500px">
        This recipe has been a go to for my family for years during the winter
        months when its too cold to use the smoke. The ribs fall off the bone
        and the liquid smoke give a great flavor. I hope your family enjoys them
        as much as mine.

      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Remove membranes from the back of ribs, if needed.</li>
        <li>Rubs seasonings over both sides of ribs.</li>
        <li>Place wire trivet rack in the bottom of the instant pot.</li>
        <li>
          Add water, apple juice (or apple cider vinegar) and liquid smoke
          (optional, but recommended for that great smokey flavor).
        </li>
        <li>
          Place the ribs upright, with the meat side facing out. If you’re using
          one large rack of ribs, then circle them around the pot.
        </li>
        <li>Secure lid and close vent.</li>
        <li>
          Press “manual” or “pressure cook” and cook on high pressure for 25
          minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          When the timer beeps, allow the pressure to naturally release for 15
          min, then turn the valve to quick release.
        </li>
        <li>
          Carefully remove ribs to a large, foil-lined baking sheet and slather
          them in BBQ sauce.
        </li>
        <li>
          Optional: broil them in the oven for 2-3 minutes to caramelize the bbq
          sauce.
        </li>
      </ol>
