      <h2>Grilled Skirt Steak Fajitas</h2>
      <p>
        This is a relatively new recipe my family and i just tried. Prior to
        grilling the steak we smoke it for 45 minutes to an hour for extra
        tenderness. The marinade is one of the best we have had with fajitas.

      <h3>Directions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>For the Fajita Marinade:</strong> Combine soy sauce, lime
          juice, canola oil, brown sugar, chili powder, garlic, cumin, and black
          pepper in a medium bowl and whisk to combine. Transfer 1/2 cup (120ml)
          marinade to a large bowl and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>For the Steak:</strong> Place steaks in a gallon-sized
          zipper-lock bag and add remaining marinade. Seal bag, squeezing out as
          much air as possible. Massage bag until meat is fully coated in
          marinade. Lay flat in the refrigerator, turning every couple of hours,
          for at least 3 hours and up to 10.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>For the Fajitas:</strong> While steak marinates, toss peppers
          and onion in bowl with reserved 1/2 cup marinade. Refrigerate until
          ready to use.
        </li>
        <li>
          When ready to cook, remove steaks from marinade, wipe off excess, and
          transfer to a large plate. Light one chimney full of charcoal. When
          all charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and arrange
          coals on one side of charcoal grate. Set cooking grate in place, cover
          grill, and allow to preheat for 5 minutes. Clean and oil grilling
          grate.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place a large cast iron skillet over cooler side of grill. Transfer
          steaks to hot side of grill. Cover and cook for 1 minute. Flip steaks,
          cover, and cook for another minute. Continue cooking in this manner,
          flipping and covering, until steaks are well charred and an
          instant-read thermometer inserted into their center registers 115 to
          120°F (46 to 49°C) for medium-rare or 125 to 130°F (52 to 54°C) for
          medium. Transfer steaks to a large plate, tent with foil, and allow to
          rest for 10 to 15 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Meanwhile, transfer cast iron skillet to hot side of grill and allow
          to preheat for 2 minutes. Add pepper and onion mix and cook, stirring
          occasionally, until vegetables are softened and beginning to char in
          spots, about 10 minutes. When vegetables are cooked, transfer steaks
          to a cutting board and pour any accumulated juices from plate into
          skillet with vegetables. Toss to coat.
        </li>
        <li>
          Transfer vegetables to a warm serving platter. Thinly slice meat
          against the grain and transfer to platter with vegetables. Serve
          immediately with hot tortillas, guacamole, pico de gallo, and other
          condiments as desired.
        </li>
      </ol>

        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <p>
          If skirt steak is unavailable, substitute with hanger or sirloin flap
          (also sold as sirloin tip in New England—it's different from sirloin
          steak). Flank steak can also be used. For best flavor, grind your own
          chili powder from a mix of equal parts ancho and guajillo chiles.
