        <h2>Grilled Skirt Steak Fajitas</h2>
        <p>
          This is a relatively new recipe my family and i just tried. Prior to
          grilling the steak we smoke it for 45 minutes to an hour for extra
          tenderness. The marinade is one of the best we have had with fajitas.

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>For the Fajita Marinade:</strong> Combine soy sauce, lime
            juice, canola oil, brown sugar, chili powder, garlic, cumin, and
            black pepper in a medium bowl and whisk to combine. Transfer 1/2 cup
            (120ml) marinade to a large bowl and set aside.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>For the Steak:</strong> Place steaks in a gallon-sized
            zipper-lock bag and add remaining marinade. Seal bag, squeezing out
            as much air as possible. Massage bag until meat is fully coated in
            marinade. Lay flat in the refrigerator, turning every couple of
            hours, for at least 3 hours and up to 10.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>For the Fajitas:</strong> While steak marinates, toss
            peppers and onion in bowl with reserved 1/2 cup marinade.
            Refrigerate until ready to use.
          </li>
          <li>
            When ready to cook, remove steaks from marinade, wipe off excess,
            and transfer to a large plate. Light one chimney full of charcoal.
            When all charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and
            arrange coals on one side of charcoal grate. Set cooking grate in
            place, cover grill, and allow to preheat for 5 minutes. Clean and
            oil grilling grate.
          </li>
          <li>
            Place a large cast iron skillet over cooler side of grill. Transfer
            steaks to hot side of grill. Cover and cook for 1 minute. Flip
            steaks, cover, and cook for another minute. Continue cooking in this
            manner, flipping and covering, until steaks are well charred and an
            instant-read thermometer inserted into their center registers 115 to
            120°F (46 to 49°C) for medium-rare or 125 to 130°F (52 to 54°C) for
            medium. Transfer steaks to a large plate, tent with foil, and allow
            to rest for 10 to 15 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Meanwhile, transfer cast iron skillet to hot side of grill and allow
            to preheat for 2 minutes. Add pepper and onion mix and cook,
            stirring occasionally, until vegetables are softened and beginning
            to char in spots, about 10 minutes. When vegetables are cooked,
            transfer steaks to a cutting board and pour any accumulated juices
            from plate into skillet with vegetables. Toss to coat.
          </li>
          <li>
            Transfer vegetables to a warm serving platter. Thinly slice meat
            against the grain and transfer to platter with vegetables. Serve
            immediately with hot tortillas, guacamole, pico de gallo, and other
            condiments as desired.
          </li>
        </ol>

          <h2>Notes</h2>
          <p>
            If skirt steak is unavailable, substitute with hanger or sirloin
            flap (also sold as sirloin tip in New England—it's different from
            sirloin steak). Flank steak can also be used. For best flavor, grind
            your own chili powder from a mix of equal parts ancho and guajillo
            chiles.
